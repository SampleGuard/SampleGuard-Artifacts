The SampleGuard app is located in the repository below:
https://github.com/SampleGuard/SampleGuard

We will upload full artifacts at publication. The artifacts will include the Python scripts we have used for preprocessing and loading APKs onto Android devices, alongside scripts we have created to analyze data generated by SampleGuard over the course of experimentation.

We will also include detailed instructions on recreating the experimental results on your own Android device.
